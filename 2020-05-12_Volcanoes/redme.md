TidyTuesday [Volcano eruption data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-05-12/readme.md)

## Question 1: What is the overall distribution of volcanoes?

I created a simple leaflet map to have a quick look. You can download it and run it [here](https://github.com/EvaMurzyn/TidyTuesdays/blob/master/2020-05-12_Volcanoes/map.html)

## Question 2: Where have the biggest eruptions happened since 0AD?
I played around with gganimate to make this [animated gif](https://github.com/EvaMurzyn/TidyTuesdays/blob/master/2020-05-12_Volcanoes/ad_big_events.gif). It doesn't want to render on Github, but you can download it.

## Question 3: Is eruption size and frequency related?
Fortunately, no! The plot of VEI and frequency looks like a small volcano, too :)

## Question 4: What are the most common event types for different volcano types?
I tried out making circular graphs, but in the end, plainer visualisations are often better. Both outcomes here:
