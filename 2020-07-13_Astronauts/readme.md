Amazing data set on [astronauts](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-07-07/readme.md) for #TidyTuesday.

And a similar visualisation, this time breaking it down into launches, and showing which vehicles were used for short tips, and which ferried astronauts for longer stays.
