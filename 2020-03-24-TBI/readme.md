[Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-03-24/readme.md) data on Traumatic Brain Injury.

## Question 1: How have causes of TBI changed across time?

There are a few interesting things here. 
1) Unintentional falls are the most common cause of ER visits and hospitalisations, and they are going up. This may be due to the ageing population, since as you will see in the next part, falls are they top TBI cause in older people.
2) ER visits due to vehicle crahses are going up, but hospitalisations and deaths have gone down. Both likely due to safer cars, and the lattera also due to better medical technology.
3) Intentional self-harm is the leading cause of deaths.

## Question 2: What is the most common injury mechanism in different age groups?

The TBI death injury mechanisms tell a very sad story here - from assault in the 0-4 age group, to self-harm in the 25-64 groups.
